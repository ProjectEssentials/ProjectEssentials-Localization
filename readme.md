# Resource-packs of Project Essentials for server-side projects.

If you want to use the mod as a plugin, then it is very simple, but there is one thing. The mod uses a localization message, instead of a raw message. And if you just put the mod on the server and log in from a client that does not have these mods, then for example with /afk you will get the message "project_essentials.afk.out_success" or something similar, but not the point.

This problem can be fixed in a very simple step. Find the resource-pack property in the server.properties file and paste this link *(below this paragraph)* there (this is a resource pack with localization).

If the localization is out of date, run `build.ps1`, it will automatically download all the localization and pack resource packs in the `out` folder.
